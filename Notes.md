Title:

Kontinuierliche Transparenz und Reproduzierbarkeit bei akademischen Publikationen: Ans√§tze und Techniken

Gist: 
- transparency starts at the package
- transparency can be monitored at the journal level
  - AEA: after acceptance, is code complete, is data cited, is data documented
  - AJPS: is data documented, does code run, is code complete
  - Astrophysics: at an early stage: is data cited, but not does it run
  - RO-Crate and other data packaging: is (input) complete, what is the software (not: does it run)

  How to follow-up?
  - scientific inquiry: building on the shoulders of predecessors
    - provide examples: Rachael, Jonathan
  - in classwork (but where to record: call out to SSRP, ReplicationWiki)
  - Replication Games!
  
How to disseminate follow-up?
  - finding them in the literature is hard (Gertler et al)
  - Comments (Peter, afterwards)
  - Journals (ZBW-run)
  - i4replication white papers
  - SSRP, ReplicationWiki
  - Journals roles: revision policy, but potentially also dynamics documents (F1000)
